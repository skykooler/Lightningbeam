Lightningbeam is currently under heavy development. Things may change often.

A patched version of PyGUI is included, and will probably become the default GUI for desktop platforms.

To run: python lightningbeam.py

I am working on including swfc binaries for all archs necessary. The Mac OSX
file is a universal binary, and runs on x86, x64 and PPC.

TODO: More info in this file.
