Lightningbeam is currently under heavy development. Things may change often.

Please note you need a patched version of PyGUI to run in PyGUI mode.
And it doesn't really run in any other mode yet. To be fixed. (maybe?)

To run: python lightningbeam

I am working on including swfc binaries for all archs necessary. The Mac OSX
file is a universal binary, and runs on x86, x64 and PPC.

TODO: More info in this file.
